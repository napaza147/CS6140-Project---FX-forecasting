## To do:
- ARIMA, CNN, and LSTM

## Implementing the ARIMA, CNN, and LSTM models, standardizing them to ensure fair comparison with the TFT model. This includes fine tuning each model for better performance, ensuring that each model is optimized and fairly assessed allowing for meaningful comparisons in predictive accuracy.
